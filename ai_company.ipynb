        "\n",
        "### 1. Enable Google Drive and Google Sheets APIs\n",
        "\n",
        "To allow the script to interact with your Google Sheets, you need to enable the relevant APIs in the Google Cloud Console.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).\n",
        "2.  Select the project you want to use (or create a new one).\n",
        "3.  In the navigation menu (top left), go to \"APIs & Services\" > \"Library\".\n",
        "4.  Search for \"Google Drive API\" and click on it. Click the \"Enable\" button.\n",
        "5.  Repeat step 4 for \"Google Sheets API\".\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Create a Service Account\n",
        "\n",
        "A service account is a special type of Google account used by applications, not people. The script will use this account to access your Google Sheet.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to \"APIs & Services\" > \"Credentials\".\n",
        "2.  Click \"Create Credentials\" and select \"Service Account\".\n",
        "3.  Provide a name for your service account (e.g., `sheet-summarizer-service`). The Service account ID will be automatically generated.\n",
        "4.  (Optional) Add a description for clarity.\n",
        "5.  Click \"Done\". You don't need to grant any roles at this stage unless you have specific project-level permissions required.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Download the Service Account's JSON Key File\n",
        "\n",
        "This file contains the credentials the script needs to authenticate as the service account.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  In the \"Credentials\" page, find the service account you just created under the \"Service Accounts\" section.\n",
        "2.  Click on the service account's email address.\n",
        "3.  Go to the \"Keys\" tab.\n",
        "4.  Click \"Add Key\" > \"Create new key\".\n",
        "5.  Select \"JSON\" as the key type and click \"Create\".\n",
        "6.  Your browser will download a JSON file. This is your service account key file. **Keep this file secure and do not share it publicly.**\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Share Your Google Sheet with the Service Account\n",
        "\n",
        "For the service account to access your specific Google Sheet, you need to share the sheet with the service account's email address.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Open the Google Sheet you want the script to read from and write to.\n",
        "2.  Click the \"Share\" button (usually in the top right).\n",
        "3.  In the \"Add people or groups\" field, paste the email address of your service account. You can find this email address in the Google Cloud Console under \"APIs & Services\" > \"Credentials\" > \"Service Accounts\". It will look something like `your-service-account-name@your-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com`.\n",
        "4.  Grant the service account \"Editor\" access to the sheet. This allows the script to read the company names and write the summaries.\n",
        "5.  Click \"Send\".\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. Secure Your Service Account Key File\n",
        "\n",
        "The JSON key file grants access to your Google Cloud resources. Treat it like a password.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Do not commit this file to version control (like Git).**\n",
        "*   **Store it in a secure location.** In Google Colab, it's recommended to upload it temporarily or store it in your Google Drive (as shown in the script's configuration section, updating `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE` to the path in your Drive)."
